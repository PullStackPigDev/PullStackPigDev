I am learning Next.js, Actix.rs, Algorithms and Data Structures with C++, Golang, VB6.0, CCC & Competitive Programming, Math skills in CEMC, gainging team and devops experiences from Hackathons/Code Jams, learning Low-Level and Sys Dev, Data Analysis with Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib, AI/ML with Tensorflow or Pytorch, SQL ( mainly Postgres and MySQL ) and working with REST/GraphQL APIs. I'd love to learn anything related to programming!

Note: I am still training myself in terms of Competitive Programming. If you have tips please LMK!

I'm currently working on getting better in school in fields of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, English & Literacy, and Computer Science.

I am learning Actix.rs, Statisical analysis and Machine learning, Algorithms and Data Structures with C++, VB6.0, CCC & Competitive Programming, Math skills in CEMC, gaining team and devops experiences from Hackathons/Code Jams, Data Analysis with Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib, ML with sklearn, ML/AI with Tensorflow or Pytorch, SQL ( mainly PostgreSQL) and working with REST APIs. I'd love to learn anything related to programming!

Note: I no longer lke Golang, GraphQL, and React/Next.js. Although I do have existing experience with them, easy to pick it back up.

I'm looking to collaborate and contribute to open source projects including concurrency, data management, optimizing algorithms and UIs.

**Languages I am familiar with:**

Confident: Python 3.6-3.10, JavaScript ES5-14, TypeScript

Confident non-programming languages: Brainf\*\*k, CSS 3, HTML 5, Markdown Syntax, JSON

Decent: C++, Rust, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Visual Basic 6

Have previous experience with: Golang

**Languages I am learning:**

None

**Languages I'm planning to learn:**

C (Sys), C# (.NET), Kotlin (JVM), Dart (Flutter), Racket ( Scheme & Waterloo ), ASM ( Very low level dev)

**Frameworks I know**

JavaScript Web Dev: (Although I generally prefer typescript)

React.js (<=18), Next.js (<=12), SvelteKit (latest), Svelte (latest), Tailwind CSS (<=3.3), SCSS/SASS (*), Stitches.js (with React 17), CSS-in-JS (with React 17), Chakra UI (with React 17), Express.js, Socket.IO, Firebase (authentication, firestore, realtime store, and storage)

*Left React as VDom is expensive

*Have worked with SvelteKit internals (as of 1.22)

Python In General:

numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, Django (REST, simpleJWT, channels, postgres integration), asyncIO, aiohttp, concurrent, asyncpg, pymongo, Flask, FastAPI, discord.py

Rust:

Actix-web (w/ actix-cors, actix-ws, actix-http, actix-identity, actix-session), sqlx, Argon2, serde, serde_json, serde_cbor, tokio, etc.

(have some experience with legacy actiz actor framework... Although it is no longer recommended by the creator)

Go

Previous experience is no longer reliable

**Tools I know how to use**

Git Version Control, GitHub, Chrome Extension API, Docker (although never used docker-compose), CMake

**Cloud Services I use**

Vercel, Netlify, Railway, Heroku, CloudFlare, Fly.io

( I want to learn about AWS, GCS and Digital Ocean but unfortunately don't have the funding )

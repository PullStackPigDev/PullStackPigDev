I'm currently working on getting better in school in fields of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, English & Literacy, Biology and Computer Science.

I am learning Next.js, Django, Algorithms and Data Structures with C++, Golang, VB.NET, CCC, CEMC, Hackathons, Low-Level and Sys Dev, ML with Tensorflow or Pytorch, SQL ( mainly Postgres ) and working with APIs. I'd love to learn anything related to programming!

I may sound like I know a lot, but inside I'm very stupid !WARNING!

I'm looking to collaborate and contribute to open source projects including concurrency, data management, optimizing algorithms and UIs although I am completely trash at it.

**Languages I am familiar with:**

Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Brainf\*\*k

**Languages I am learning:**

C++, Golang, Swift, SQL

**Languages I'm planning to learn:**
Rust (Sys), C (Sys), C# (.NET), Kotlin (JVM), Solidity (Blockchain), Dart (Flutter), Racket ( Esoteric & Waterloo ), ASM ( Very low level dev), Linux Shell ( Servers )
